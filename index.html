               <div id="textBTME"> I am a highly efficient student with a High School diploma at Hoërskool Waterkloof and currently studying full time at the University of Pretoria. I am well organized and a consistent worker. I am always happy to help and work towards being a better student. I have now completed part of my first year with multiple distinctions for my Information and Knowledge Systems Degree. I see myself as quick learner and some-one that will work hard, be consistent and work with great enthusiasm.  </div>
